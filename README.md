## Hi there Tikshil here,

I am a dedicated self-taught developer with a diploma in mechanical engineering, who has successfully transitioned into the tech industry. My passion for coding led me to independently learn programming and earn a certificate as a full stack developer through online courses. I am currently focused on front-end development and am actively seeking opportunities in this field. My diverse background and self-motivated learning journey have equipped me with a strong foundation in problem-solving, creativity, and a continuous drive for growth and excellence in the world of web development.ðŸ‘‹

- âš¡ Fun fact: The first computer bug was an actual bug! In 1947, engineers found a moth causing trouble in the Harvard Mark II computer, and that's how the term "debugging" was born. So, if your code ever has bugs, just remember you're following a tradition that started with a literal insect!
